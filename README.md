### Introduction

WebJars are client-side web libraries that are packaged into Java Archive (JAR) files.  In addition to being available in the downloadable JAR files, these libraries' files are also accessible through jsDelivr, a free CDN (Content Delivery Network).  OpenSeadragon, the JavaScript library available through this WebJars package, is an open-source, web-based viewer for zoomable images.
